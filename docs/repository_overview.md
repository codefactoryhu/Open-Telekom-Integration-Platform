## Components and Recommended Versions

The table below provides insights into the generally expected maturity of the existing release versions of the
individual Helm charts and components. It distinguishes between **Latest**, **Staging**, and **Production Ready**.

**Latest** refers to the newest release version of a component that has undergone all regular (integration) tests and
quality checks but for which little operational experience exists. Therefore no direct recommendation can be made for
use in staging (non-prod) environments.
However, you might want to try these versions non-productively in advance to possibly test a new feature as early
adopter.

**Staging** refers to a new release for which operational experience in non-productive (staging) environments already
exists. These versions are candidates for possible productive use.

**Production Ready** refers to a release version for which operational experience in productive environments already
exists and can therefore be recommended for productive use.
